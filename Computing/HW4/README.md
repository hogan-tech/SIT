I pledge my honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System.

## 1. Bugs or issues
No known bugs or issues.

## 2. Resolved issues
Initially, in `date.py`, the leap year function didn't correctly account for century years that aren't divisible by 400. I fixed this by properly implementing the leap year logic.
In `time.py`, face None type in startTime, and fix it from removing startTime setting in reset().
